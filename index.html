				<td> <h4> The Braves are the professional baseball franchise that
				moved to Atlanta in 1966. They have only won one World Series in their existence in
				Atlanta which came in 1995. Although only winning one World Series for Atlanta,
				they have been featured in the playoffs numerous times during the last couple decades.
				Some people consider this year to a rebuilding year for the Braves, but I think
				they are on track for great success in the near future.  Their roster is full of
				great, young stars including: Freddie Freeman, Julio Teheran, and Dansby Swanson.
				<br>
					The Braves recently chose to relocate to the Cobb County leaving Turner Field behind.
				They played at Turner Field for twenty years and have made many great memories there.
				Starting this season, they are playing in SunTrust Park which will be brand new and
				very accommodating to its guests.  Come out and support your Atlanta Braves at their
				new stadium this season! You can buy tickets with the button to the left or visit the
				braves website below. </h4>

				<button type="button" onclick="alert('Come out to the new Falcons Stadium next season! Get your tickets at www.vividseats.com/NFL/Falconsâ€Ž')">Tickets!</button></th>
				<td> <h4> The Atlanta Falcon's professional football franchise
				officially began in 1965 when they joined the National Football League.  The Falcons
				are very important to the city of Atlanta and all its residents.  They are most known
				for their superstars players in Deion Sanders and Michael Vick.  They were both
				extraordinary athletes and led the Falcons to many great successful seasons.
				However just last year for the first time ever, they made the Super Bowl.  Although
				they came up short in the end, it made history for the Atlanta Falcons and this past
				season will be remembered forever.  They can only improve from here though with
				stars like Matt Ryan, Julio Jones, and Devonta Freeman.  They have many bright years ahead.<br>   
				Like the Braves, the Falcons have also chosen to relocate for their next season.
				This time they arejust moving across the street to the new Mercedez-Benz Stadium.
				This new stadium is estimated tohave cost over one and half billion dollars!
				It will feature a retractable roof, cushioned seats,and  a huge mega screen.This will
				be by far the nicest stadium in all of America when it is finished.  The Falcons
				need your support in their new stadium so buy tickets for the upcoming season with the
				button on the left or visit their website below. </h4>

				<button type="button" onclick="alert('Visit Phillips Arena and watch your Hawks battle it out in the Playoffs. Get tickets at www.nba.com/hawks/tickets/')">Tickets!</button></th>
				<td> <h4> The Hawks are the professional basketball team that has
				played in Atlanta since 1968.  They recently changed ownership to Antony Ressler,
				who purchased the team for $850 million dollars from the Atlanta Spirit Company.
				The most famous player to ever have played for the Atlanta Hawks is Dominique
				Wilkens.  He was a very exciting player and can now be found in the NBA Hall
				of Fame.  The Hawks have been considered pretty average over their life span.
				They play their games in Phillips Arena which is right next to the Mercedes-Benz
				Stadium. They are extremely popular in the city of Atlanta.<br>
				The Hawks have been increasing consistently over the recent times and have made
				the playoffs for several consecutive seasons.  They are currently featured in
				the NBA playoffs right now as they face the Washington Wizards.  They are projected
				to beat the Wizards where they will most likely face off against the dreaded
				Cleveland Cavaliers.  They will need all of your support to get past the Wizards
				and then to defeat Lebron James and the Cavaliers.  So come out and see a game
				in Phillips arena this post-season: you can find tickets if you click the button
				to the left or visit their official website. </h4>
